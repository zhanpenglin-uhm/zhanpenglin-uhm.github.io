This is the first time I have ever used TypeScript, and my first impression is that it feels really different from what I'm used to. But there are also many familiar things to other programming languages I have used in the past as well. Overall, it feels decently new but still manageable.<br><br><br><br><br><br>


## The Differences

One of the biggest differences I found intresting about typescript is the way it handle datatypes. For most of the coding languages I use, before we needed to include a datatype or else the code will usally throw an error. But Typescript threw a curveball with it being able to work even without explicitly including the datatype. I understand it's still a good idea to include it anyway, but I did find it really interesting that it will allow you to create a variable without including the datatype yourself.

Another interesting concept I found is the idea of vari, let, and const. Before, I was used to being restricted to only allowing one variable to a certain name. The way the transcript allows me to chose if I want to do that and being able to create 2 variables of the same name seems intresting to me. I can see how it might be useful at times, but it can also cause many unintended issues, which is why let and const can be really useful. Still, I like that this is still an option. 

The layout and syntax also feels pretty different from other languages I learn before, like python, java, and C, but it should be fine after getting use to it a bit. 

## Similar

Even though a lot of the syntax of Typescript looks different from what I'm use to and it also allows for more options in design, the basics of the language seems to be simliar to most other languages. The baisc datatypes seems to be the same, and you can also still creat classes and objects in TypeScript. 

Typescript still have all the basic components of other coding languges I've use and learn before, just with a difference emphasis on different parts.

## Overall View

Overall, I feel like TypeScript is an intresting coding language that feels decently different from what I have use before. So far, I would say I like the way it's set up and can understand at least the basics of it well. The only thing I'm having trouble with so far is some of the strange syntax it include to shorten or meant to make code more readable. I saw some of this syntax in [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#basic-javascript), specifically the ES6 section. It took me a while to understand what it was trying to convey, but I think with time and practice, I should be able to understand what it is saying.

In short, TypeScript is a really new language to me espcially some of the weird syntax it inlcudes. But with time, I feel optimistic that I can learn and understand how and where I would use this coding language in.
