This is a project I did back in ics 212. The coding and implmentation wasn't done in a IDE but with command prompt at the unix server UH provided us with. This was a really intrsting experince for me since this was my first class where we had to code outside of a IDE.

The project had us create a user interface with 5 options:

  1. Add - add an account with a name and an address
  2. Find - find a certain account and print it
  3. Printall - print all account
  4. Delete - delete an account
  5. Quit - end the program

We had to implement each of the following fucntion as well as making sure we have a way to save all the non deleted data when we boot up the program after we end it.

This project give me a chance to work with unix and C in a way where I can actually test what I've learn and what I still need to work on. We had to work with a few different files and compile them together to make our program. We also went over how to implement a debugged mode in the program. 

Overall it really help me understand coding in a unix enviorment a lot more and how coding with an older coding language like C feels like.

This a part of the code I use in the project:
