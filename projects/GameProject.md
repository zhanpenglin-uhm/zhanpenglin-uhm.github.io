This is the final project I had to do for my high school coding class and was my inrodction to coding a big project. 

The assighnment had us create a text adventures game with what we learn that semester about python. We made the game in a coding Integrated Development Environments website called [Replit](https://replit.com/). I was able to complete the project in about 3 weeks. 

This project give me a chance to experince how it feels to work on a larger coding project. It halp me learn the importance of orginzing my code and how creating mupltpy smaller function for a single purpose can make life a lot easier. I also got a chance to desghn my own code instead of trying to create program base of on given instructions. 

Looking back at it now the code defnenly have a lot of things I can do better at and it was still a bit of a mess orginzation wise. But it was the first time I had a chance to work on a more personal project and also the thing that really boost my intrest in coding.  

This a part of the code I use in the project:
